# PhANNs

PhANNs is a tool to classify any phage ORF as one of 10 structural protein class, or as "others". It uses an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks.

## Quick start

The easiest way to run PhANNs it to use the [Web server.](https://edwards.sdsu.edu/phanns)

## Repository

The repository is divided in two parts. The ["web\_server"](https://github.com/Adrian-Cantu/PhANNs/tree/master/web_server) directory contains all you need to run PhANNs locally. The ["model\_training"](https://github.com/Adrian-Cantu/PhANNs/tree/master/model_training) directory contains the code to download sequences and to train and test the Artificial Neural Networks.


## Paper

PhANNs paper is under review, a preprint is availble from bioRxiv [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.023523v1).
