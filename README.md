# PhANNs

PhANNs is a tool to classify any phage ORF as one of 10 structural protein class, or as "others". It uses an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks.

## Quick start

The easiest way to run PhANNs it to use the [Web server.](https://edwards.sdsu.edu/phanns)

## Repository

The repository is divided in two parts. The ["web\_server"](https://edwards.sdsu.edu/phanns/web_server) directory contains all you need to run PhANNs locally. The ["model\_training"](https://edwards.sdsu.edu/phanns/model_training) directory contains the code to download sequences and to train and test the Artificial Neural Networks.
