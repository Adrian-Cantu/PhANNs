For each input sequence, PhANNs run 10 ANNs predictions. Each of those 10 ANNs outputs
the soft-max scores for every class (a number between 0 and 1, such that the score of each class adds to 1). <br>
PhANNs outputs the per class sum of the ANNs scores. The input sequence is classified as the class with the 
highest score (highlighted in yellow).
Furthermore the Precision score shows which proportion of sequences in test set, classified as that class with that score or better, were correctly classified.
